Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

Select Count(*) From Table;

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i.      Attribute table = 10000
ii.     Business table = 10000
iii.    Category table = 10000
iv.     Checkin table = 10000
v.      elite_years table = 10000
vi.     friend table = 10000
vii.    hours table = 10000
viii.   photo table = 10000
ix.     review table = 10000
x.      tip table = 10000
xi.     user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

Select Count(Distinct key) From Table;

i.      Business = id : 10000
ii.     Hours = business_id : 1562
iii.    Category = business_id : 2643
iv.     Attribute = business_id : 1115
v.      Review = id : 10000, business_id: 8090, user_id: 9581
vi.     Checkin = business_id: 493
vii.    Photo = id: 10000, business_id: 6493
viii.   Tip = user_id: 537, business_id: 3979
ix. 	User = id: 10000
x. 		Friend = user_id: 11
xi. 	Elite_years = user_id: 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: No
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	SELECT COUNT(*)
		FROM user
		WHERE id IS NULL OR
		  name IS NULL OR

		  compliment_photos IS NULL;
	
	

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	SELECT AVG(column) FROM table;

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars

		min: 1		max: 5		avg: 3.7082


	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars

		min: 1 		max: 5		avg: 3.6549


	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes

		min: 0		max: 2		avg: 0.0144


	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count

	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count

		min: 0		max: 2000		avg: 24.2995


5. List the cities with the most reviews in descending order:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	Select Sum(review_count) As "Number Of Reviews",
           city
    From business
    Group By city
    Order By "Number Of Reviews" DESC;

   No, I don't think so.

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	Upon running the following query,
	" SELECT name,
       review_count AS "Reviews Count",
       fans
    FROM user
    Order By fans desc;	"

    The results obtained are as under:
    +-----------+---------------+------+
    | name      | Reviews Count | fans |
    +-----------+---------------+------+
    | Amy       |           609 |  503 |  <------

    | Nicole    |           161 |   73 |
    +-----------+---------------+------+

	As we can see from the above table, there occur instances where the higher number of review counts don't assure higher fans.
	For instance, Any has 503 fans with merely 609 reviews. Whereas,  despite having 2000 reviews, Gerald has only 253 fans.
	Few other such instances have been indicated using " <------- "

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: Yes, there are more appreciative comments than hate comments.
	This can be confirmed as there are 1780 love comments whereas only 232 hate comments. (The output obtained is as under)

	+----------+-------+
    | Category | Count |
    +----------+-------+
    | Hate     |   232 |
    | Love     |  1780 |
    +----------+-------+

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	SELECT 'Love' As Category,
        Count(*) As "Count"
    From review
    where text like "%love%"

    UNION

    SELECT 'Hate' As Category,
            Count(*) As "Count"
    From review
    where text like "%hate%";

	
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	SELECT name, fans
    From user
    Order By fans DESC
    Limit 10;

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating.
   Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

   The 4-5 star group seems to have shorter hours then the 2-3 star group.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
         
    There isn't a binary answer to this analysis. Thus, Yes and no, one of the 4-5 star group has a lot more reviews
    but then the other 4-5 star group has close to the same number of reviews as the 2-3 star group.


iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

    No, every business is in a different zip-code.

SQL code used for analysis:

    SELECT b.name, h.hours, b.review_count, b.postal_code,
    CASE
        WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '2-3 stars'
        WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '4-5 stars'
    END AS "Star Rating",

    CASE
        WHEN hours LIKE "%monday%" THEN 1
        WHEN hours LIKE "%tuesday%" THEN 2
        WHEN hours LIKE "%wednesday%" THEN 3
        WHEN hours LIKE "%thursday%" THEN 4
        WHEN hours LIKE "%friday%" THEN 5
        WHEN hours LIKE "%saturday%" THEN 6
        WHEN hours LIKE "%sunday%" THEN 7
    END AS "Day Number"

    FROM business b
    LEFT JOIN category c ON c.business_id = b.id
    LEFT JOIN hours h ON h.business_id = b.id

    WHERE ( b.city == 'Las Vegas' AND c.category LIKE 'shopping')
            AND
          (b.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 OR b.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5)
    GROUP BY  stars,"Day Number", name
    ORDER BY "Day Number" ,"Star Rating" ASC;

		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
    The average star rating is higher for businesses that are open than
    businesses that are closed.

        Open:   AVG(stars) = 3.679
        Closed: AVG(stars) = 3.520

ii. Difference 2:
    The businesses that are open tend to have more reviews than ones that
    are closed on average.

        Open:   AVG(review_count) = 31.757
        Closed: AVG(review_count) = 23.198


SQL code used for analysis:
    SELECT
        CASE
          WHEN is_open = 0 THEN "Closed"
          WHEN is_open = 1 THEN "Open"
        END AS "Status",
        COUNT(DISTINCT(id)) AS "Count",
        AVG(review_count),
        SUM(review_count),
        AVG(stars)
    FROM business
    GROUP BY is_open;

	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp
dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to
find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number
of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and
come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:

	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

    Predicting whether a business will stay open or close. The motivation behind this analysis is the previous question.
    I choose to continue building over the previous results.
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

    The types of data that can help business understand the factors ensuring continued operation of their business can be
    number of reviews, how many stars the business has & the location of the business entity.
    The reason for choosing the above fields is the correlation we drew in the previous question where there was a heavy
    stress on stars and reviews to determine the operational status of the business. To further understand the success factor,
    I have chosen the new fields 'location'.
    I plan to use the City, Postal Code (and possibly latitude & longitude) to better account for location in the analysis.

    It would have been more exhaustive analysis had I decided to include the operational hours on each weekday independently.
    It would have helped to understand if the business unit is active during the peak sale hours. 
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
